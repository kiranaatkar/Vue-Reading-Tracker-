# Vue-Reading-Tracker-

To help me learn Vue. At University I went into citation hell where I'd keep going one level deeper into different papers and would lose track on which ones I actually wanted to use/ which ones had useful bits and which ones I hadn't read yet. The idea of this app is to create a simple reading tracker where you can input papers, add comments and colour code based on whether you want to include them or not. I'd love to go on to autogenerate a Citation for the paper but that is above and beyond.

TO run, install the vue Command Line Interface with

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

or

```
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

then cd into the reading-tracker folder and run

```
npm run serve
```

to get it up and running on http://localhost:8080/
