# Vue-Reading-Tracker-
To help me learn Vue. At University I went into citation hell where I'd keep going one level deeper into different papers and would lose track on which ones I actually wanted to use/ which ones had useful bits and which ones I hadn't read yet. The idea of this app is to create a simple reading tracker where you can input papers, add comments and colour code based on whether you want to include them or not. I'd love to go on to autogenerate a Citation for the paper but that is above and beyone.
